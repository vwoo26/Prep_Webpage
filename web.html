<p>This article elaborates on the life and legacy of Katherine Kent, highlighting her
influence on British society, further suggesting direction for remaining senior royals. During
her time as serving as Duchess of Kent, she dedicated most of her lifetime sponsoring artists
and charities, supporting people through difficult times. Rather than chasing fame or
spotlights, she chose kindness behind the scene. After she retired from royal duties in 2002,
she spent the rest of her life teaching music at hull primary school. Her footage of life has
allowed many citizens of England to feel connected to royals.
While her death does not directly affect English society, it seems to leave a
memorable impression on people. Katherine was the first royal family member to convert
from the Church of Britain to Catholicism, as well as first to have a catholic funeral since the
reign of King Henry VIII. On the other hand, Queen Camilla withdrawing from attending
Katherineâ€™s funeral raises questions of whether she would be able to resume her political
duties.</p>
